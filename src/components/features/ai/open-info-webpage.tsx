						Information is power*. Public information is public power, which no
						single entity should keep to itself. We urge for public information
						to be open, accessible, and available to all.
						<br />
						<br />
						Once, the Internet was a frontier of openness, with information
						freely exchanged on independent servers. Today, this landscape has
						shifted. Major platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and
						TikTok control and gate trillions of pieces of public information,
						which they are supposed to share with the whole world.
						<br />
						<br />
						Public information is information created with the intention of
						being free, and thus is to be disseminated without limit or
						constraint. Once brought into existence, its freedom becomes
						inherent. And by no way should any single entity determine its
						existence, flow, and interpretation. When we, digital livings, chose
						comfort and easiness over freedom, power was inadvertently handed to
						a small group of people waiting to exploit us. First, we started
						using apps and services that seemed to make life easier, but before
						we knew it, we found ourselves praying for our cyber overlords to do
						us no evil.
						<br />
						<br />
						Information freedom does not naturally evolve, it degrades.
						<br />
						<br />
						The way to resist digital slavery is not by sitting and wishing for
						another small group of super heroes to battle the super villains who
						were once the heroes themselves. As we the people have fought for
						equality, independence, and freedom of our physical land and body,
						each one of us needs to fight for the same for our digital world and
						being.
						<br />
						<br />
						It’s not hard to join the fight. To begin with, when you want to
						post something like a blog or a picture, consider sharing it through
						a channel that you know is not controlled by a single party. It
						could be a blockchain, a decentralized network, or even a hosted
						website if you are looking for something more old-fashioned. And if
						posting on these platforms alone won’t achieve your goal as your
						friends and fans are kept within closed social graphs, post on both
						places so at least the copy on the open web is free to flow. And, if
						you happen to be someone with adequate technical skills, consider
						running some nodes and write some code to make open networks better
						- every action, no matter how small, fortifies our collective power.
						<br />
						<br />
						Data giants were not born this way, we sculpted them into their
						current form. They are huge only because we have been feeding them
						an enormous amount of information and have never asked for much in
						return. If they can grow into giants with the power we grant them,
						imagine what can be accomplished with that power being redirected
						towards the public good. As a species, homo sapiens process
						information better than any other species on earth, and that is how
						we climbed to the top. The Internet, as the “roads among minds”,
						further boosts our efficiency - we’ve never witnessed the creation
						and dissemination of information at such an unprecedented scale in
						history. For us to advance, we need to make sure thoughts and ideas
						can flow freely on these roads. It’s time to fight for open
						information - we must build a future digital world where information
						empowers all, not just a select few.
